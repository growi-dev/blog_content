# Hello World
Hi there. 
This is an experiment for me. I am not one for putting opinions out there to people I don't know personally. My jabs are usually directed at the deserving. Also I usually don't like to put something out there if I am not very sure about it.
But I think that has to change. So I want to take this as an opportunity to clarify and structure my thoughts, seek feedback, provide and collect some advice. 
I started a journey a while back. I am on my way to becoming a software architect. I still have some road ahead of me but I am at a point where I feel the need to reach out to people who share my path.
Whether or not that is you, I welcome you to this little blog and hope you find it's contents useful or at least interesting. Please drop me a line and tell me what you think.
