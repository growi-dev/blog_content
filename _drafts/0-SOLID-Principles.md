Software Architecture 


This is the first article on a series about software architecture guided by the SOLID principles.

Architecture happens on different levels. <strike>It is almost like a fractal image every part of it reflects the whole. </strike>

# Overview
- motivation: 
	- extensability
	- maintainability
	- clarity
	- structure
	- 




# The Principles
## Single responsibility principle
slice it and dice it
## Open-close principle
when to close
## Liskov substitution principle
- stateless methods (the programmer is the enemy)
## Interface segregation principle
stateless again (the programmer is the enemy)
minimal interface
slice it and dice it again
## Dependency inversion principle
the easy one 

# Case Study
