# The Slow Learner
#### or discovering why shit is complicated

In this post I'd like to share the story of my personal learning experience and how it got me started on my journey to become a software architect.

## How it all began
I've been writing code since I was 12 years old. And while I don't want to bore you wth my life's story, 
i need you to untestand where I'm coming from so you migth understand where I am going and why.

First I was just tinkering with computers to make the latest games run on my dad's PC. That was the era of the Intel 80386 and MS DOS. It was the prehistoric time before the Web was readily available and knowledge of computers was something that still made you stand out. 
The time when games were traded in the school yard and we tried adding `LH` in front of  every driver definition in the `autoexec.bat` to make them run.

In high school I met a friend who owned his very own Commodore 64 and he was awsome. He could make his computer do stuff because he knew BASIC. Thanks to him I discovered programming and not only that, I found out that MS DOS came with a magical tool called`QBASIC.EXE`. 

QBASIC was my first programming language. It taught me about `if` and `while`, Subs and Functions. Also: `GOTO`. At that time I had no resorces that could teach me programming in a structured way. My friend lived in a household where some computer magazines existed but I did not. I am pretty shure that even the local library had nothing of the sort at the time. So we mainly learned by messing around. It was the ultimate trial and error approach.

Later we took a computer course in school where they taught Turbo Pascal but at that point there was nothing new besides syntax. It was the mid 90s and while the Web took off we starting messing around with HTML and later JavaScript, Websites where really shiny back then.

My friend moved on to become PHP dev while I messed around with VisualBasic, VBScript (in an infrastructure job), Java (they had Applets!) then C# (because it is beautiful), then LotusScipt (because I needed the money) and finally Java again. Somewhere on the way I got infected with the OO paradigm.

While it took me only one paragraph to give the highlights of my programming experience, for the most part it felt like years in hell. Don't get me wrong, I love to code. I love reading code. I love to see how it all fits together. Getting there tho, that's a different story.

## Missing Skills
I'm not a feature complete human being. I'm not a feature complete software engineer. I have many shortcomings and some of them impacted my carrer quite a bit. 
Learning being the most prominent of them. 

I have major difficulties learning mechanical skills.
By mechanical skills I mean skills that require you to follow a given set of instructions to solve a problem. The core skill here is to select the right strategy, follow the right path thru the instruction set, to handle the problem. 
To be able to efficiently apply the core problem solving skill you need to know the instruction set, all of it.
Learning the instruction set without context comes down to memorizing a bunch of useless stuff. Useless because there aren't any connections to concepts you already know and understand.

Math can bee like that when it's being taught wrong (at least up to a point). Coding can be like that too. 
People who are able to utilize mechanical skills are getting to solutions quickly. They are able to show proficiancy in a newly aquired skill quickly. They get the work done. And maybe when they did it long enough, applied the skill often enough, they grasp the core concepts in the end. Or maybe not. They are still getting stuff done. 
I'm not one of those people. 

I need to understand stuff. How? and Why? are my standard questions and they are being applied to everything. And if they aren't being answered sufficiently I get frustrated but I dont learn anything. If you can't explain it I don't care. I learn concepts not algorithms,
I'm shure you can see how this mindset can be an obstacle. But what can I say? I'm just wired that way.

## Frustrations
reading docs
asking why
asking how

## Counterpoint
learning concepts
asking the why
learning patterns

## Comprehension
I've newer written the same code twice (don't tell my employer)

i tend to stare at code for hours while coming up with a design that fits all my use cases at once 

## Control
puzzle solving
code is a jigsaw puzzle

## Design
Uncle Bob
SOLID 

## TL;DR
I am stupid and need to see the inner workings of stuff to be able to use it. That lead me to getting good at building stuff.
