# The Slow Learner
#### Or discovering why shit is complicated

In this post I'd like to tell the story of my personal learning experience and how it got me started on my journey to become a software architect.
## How it all began
I've been writing code since I was 12 years old. 

First I was just tinkering with computers to make the latest games run on my dad's PC. That was the era of the Intel  80386 and MS DOS. It was the prehistoric time before the Web was readily available and knowledge of computers was something that still made you stand out. 
The time when games were traded in the school yard and we tried adding `LH` in front of  every driver definitions in the `autoexec.bat` to make them run.

In school I met a friend who owned his very own Commodore 64 and he was awsome. He could make his computer do stuff because he knew BASIC. Thanks to him I discovered programming and not only that I found out that MS DOS came with `QBASIC.EXE`. 

QBASIC was my first programming language. It taught me about `if` and `while`, Subs and Functions. Also: `GOTO`. At that time I had no resorces that could teach me programming in a structured way. My friend lived in a household where some computer magazines existed but I did not. I am pretty shure that even the local library had nothing of the sort at that time. So we mainly learned by messing around. It was the ultimate trial and error approach.

Later we took a computer course in school where they taught Turbo Pascal but at that point there was nothing new besides syntax. It was the late '90s and while the Web took off we starting messing around with HTML and later JavaScript,


i love to code
i love reading code
i love to see how it all fits together

i tend to stare at code for hours while coming up with a design that fits all my use cases at once 

## Missing Skills
memorize stuff
just use what other have given you

## Frustrations
reading docs
asking why
asking how
## Counterpoint
learning concepts
asking the why
learning patterns
## Comprehension
I've newer wrote the same code twice (don't tell my employer)
## Control
puzzle solving
code is a jigsaw puzzle
## Design
Uncle Bob
SOLID 
## TL;DR
I am stupid and need to see the inner workings of stuff to be able to use it. That lead me to getting good at building stuff.
