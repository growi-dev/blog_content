# What? Who? Why?
In this post I'd like to clarify what this blog should be about and why I am writing it. It's a hopes and dreams thing.

## What
This blog is about writing software. It is about structuring and maintaining software. It is about software craftsmanship. It is about the difference between a programmer and a software engineer.

## Who 
My name is Björn Großewinkelmann, you can call me growi. I am a software engineer who works mainly on java enterprise applications. It is at times a humbling, frustrating and far too often anger inducing experience. 
It can be humbling to work with well designed and maintained frameworks. Frameworks that promote clean code and utilize well thought out designs.
Frustrations arise, as it is so often the case, from the project management part of the job and there are certain steps to mitigate those. This is not what this blog is about.
Anger comes from taking stuff to personal. In my case taking colde, especially code quality and structure, to personal. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't just happen when I read someone else's code, it also happens when I am forced to compromise my own, sometimes aspirational, standards. The fix here is to communicate the need for clean code and architecture and be able to persuade your colleagues and management. This is a skill where I find myself lacking, so naturally I choose to make that the main focus of this blog.

## Why

Creating software had always an aesthetical component for me. And by that I do not mean in regard of UI design. I find beauty in well structured source code. I am the one of your colleagues who scolds you for too many or not enough white spaces, commented out code blocks and .
