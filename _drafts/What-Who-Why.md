# What? Who? Why?
In this post I'd like to clarify what this blog should be about and why I am writing it. It's a hopes and dreams thing.

## What
This blog is about writing software. It is about structuring and maintaining software. It is about software craftsmanship. It is about the difference between a programmer and a software engineer.

## Who 
My name is Björn Großewinkelmann, you can call me growi. I am a software engineer who works mainly on java enterprise applications. It is at times a humbling, frustrating and far too often anger inducing experience. 
It can be humbling to work with well designed and maintained frameworks. Frameworks that promote clean code and utilize well thought out designs.
Frustrations arise, as it is so often the case, from the project management part of the job and there are certain steps to mitigate those. That is not what this blog is about.
Anger comes from taking stuff too personal. In my case taking code, especially code quality and structure, to personal. Don't get me wrong, anger doesn't just happen when I read someone else's code, it also happens when I am forced to compromise my own, sometimes aspirational, standards. The fix here is to communicate the need for clean code and architecture and to be able to persuade your colleagues and management. This is a skill where I find myself lacking, so naturally I choose that to make it the main focus of this blog.

## Why

Creating software had always an aesthetical component for me. And I don't mean that in regard of UI design. I find beauty in well structured source code. I am the one of your colleagues who scolds you for too many or not enough white spaces, commented out code blocks and uber classes. 
My desire to write clean and concise code dove me to study software architecture and design patterns. Today I am not only able to write clean, concise and versatile code, but also design decoupled components and entire systems that are elegant and maintainable. The thing is I can't communicate why this is a good thing. For me it always was an inherent property: clean code is beautiful code, beautiful code is maintainable code, maintainable code has to be the goal, right? "It works." is not the end of the development process. It is the beginning. Just because you know how to do something doesn't mean you know how to do it well.

In this blog I'll try to show how to do it well and why that is important. I invited you to follow me on my journey to become a true software architect. Someone who can design elegant systems and communicate the necessity of the design process and it's choices. Someone who can take requirements and transform them into a system that not only meets them, but one that software engineers actually want to build.
I am not there yet. There is much I do not know. I am still learning the trade. My technical knowledge is as imperfect as is my ability to work as a smooth interface between business requirements and system design.

To be able to build on what I do know and to gain the experience I need to evolve, I have to clarify my thoughts and structure my knowledge. And that is what this blog is about. It will be my personal log of that journey. 
Also there will be cats.
