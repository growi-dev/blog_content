# What? Who? Why?
In this post I'd like to clarify what this blog should be about and why I am writing it. It's a hope and dreams thing.

## What
This blog is about writing software. It is about structuring and maintaining software. It is about software craftsmanship. It is about the difference between a programmer and a software engineer.

## Who 
My name is Björn Großewinkelmann, you can call me growi. I am a software engineer who works manly on enterprise applications. It is a at times a humbling, frustrating and far to often anger inducing experience.
The anger coming from bad design practices  

## Why
learn to articulate my ideas and beliefes
also: it*s needed
